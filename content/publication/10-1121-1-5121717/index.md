abstract: Acoustic cues are characteristic patterns in the speech signal that provide
  lexical, prosodic, or additional information, such as speaker identity. In particular,
  acoustic cues related to linguistic distinctive features can be extracted and marked
  from the speech signal. These acoustic cues can be used to infer the intended underlying
  phoneme sequence in an utterance. This study describes a framework for labeling
  acoustic cues in speech, including a suite of canonical cue prediction algorithms
  that facilitates manual labeling and provides a standard for analyzing variations
  in the surface realizations. A brief examination of subsets of annotated speech
  data shows that labeling acoustic cues opens the possibility of detailed analyses
  of cue modification patterns in speech.
