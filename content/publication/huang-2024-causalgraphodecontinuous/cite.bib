 abstract = {Real-world multi-agent systems are often dynamic and continuous,
  where the agents co-evolve and undergo changes in their trajecto
  ries and interactions over time. For example, the COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. can be viewed as a multi-agent system, where
  states act as agents and daily population movements between them
  are interactions. Estimating the counterfactual outcomes in such
  systems enables accurate future predictions and effective decision-
  making, such as formulating COVID-19 policies. However, existing
  methods fail to model the continuous dynamic effects of treatments
  on the outcome, especially when multiple treatments (e.g., "stay-
  at-home" and "get-vaccine" policies) are applied simultaneously.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose Causal Graph Ordinary Dif-
  ferential Equations (CAG-ODE), a novel model that captures the
  continuous interaction among agents using a Graph Neural Net-
  work (GNN) as the ODE function. The key innovation of our model
  is to learn time-dependent representations of treatments and incor-
  porate them into the ODE function, enabling precise predictions
  of potential outcomes. To mitigate confounding bias, we further
  propose two domain adversarial learning-based objectives, which
  enable our model to learn balanced continuous representations
  that are not affected by treatments or interference. Experiments on two datasets (i.e., COVID-19 and tumor growth) demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model.},
